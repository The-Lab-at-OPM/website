#### Format

Classroom-based workshop

#### Description

Human-centered design (HCD) is a method that creates the conditions to better understand people and their needs. IDS can be an opportunity to help create those conditions to potentially transform your program, policies, or people. To delve into this approach, the Lab offers an immersive experience customized to your needs. The Lab will work with you to get all relevant stakeholders at the table, and you’ll work collaboratively to learn HCD principles and apply them to a complex challenge.

We’ll first provide a grounding in the practical approaches to HCD we use to help surface the needs of the people you are serving. Next, we’ll move on to applying those practices to a complex challenge that you would like to explore in partnership with a community of learners — individuals and organizations working on the same challenge together.

#### Learning outcomes

* Learn the fundamentals of human-centered design 
* Practice applying HCD to a complex, real-world issue;
