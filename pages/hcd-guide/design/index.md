  Your <a href="https://github.com/labopm/HCD-Guides" title="Discovery Phase" target="_blank" class="usa-prose__hcd-guide_a hcd-guide__print_not_visible ">Discovery Phase</a> is complete or is wrapping up, and you and your team are ready to move into the Design phase. 
  In this phase, the team will build on the research completed in the Discovery phase in 
  order to create action in the form of a designed or evolved product, service, or 
  system from what you learned. 
  <span class="usa-prose__hcd-guide__highlight_copy usa-prose__hcd-guide__highlight_copy_off">In this phase, you and the team will design sustainable</span> 
  products and services that answer the needs of the people on whom you centered your Discovery phase. 
  Use this Concept Guide to help you understand the Why behind the design process. 
  You&rsquo;ll be able to find the How in the upcoming HCD Design Phase Operations Guide. 
  For guidance on How in the meantime, see the

<h2>What you should have done so far</h2>
<p>
  Since you have either completed or are wrapping up the Discovery Phase, that means the team has:
</p>

<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_left">
  <p>
    Partnered with stakeholders to understand their broad needs and area 
    of desired investigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Performed a literary review to understand the quantitative and qualitative data 
    and professional opinions, patterns, project successes and failures 
    that already exists the area of investigation prior to this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Synthesized that information and identified productive areas work that the team can 
    perform to build upon that published knowledge.
  </p>  
</div>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_right">
  <p>
    Defined, based on that understanding, a problem frame to investigate and 
    received sign off on it from stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Performed qualitative field research that centers on the experiences 
    and desired futures of the people who live or participate in the area 
    of exploration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Synthesized the qualitative data gathered in that field research and 
    compiled it into insights and opportunities for stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communicated those insights and opportunities to stakeholders.

<h2 id="design-phase">What to expect in the Design Phase</h2>
<p>
  To set you and your team up for success in the Design Phase, this Guide 
  is broken down into several parts. As was stated before, this Guide 
  focuses on the Why of each of these steps. Knowing the Why behind each 
  step will allow you to cross apply what you learn and practice in this 
  Guide into new projects as you continue in your career. These concepts include:
</p>

    and application of high-level

<h2 id="timeline">A note on timeline</h2>
<p>
  Each Design Phase differs depending on the nature of the product, service, or system, 
  the bandwidth and expertise of the team, access to the participants and stakeholders, 
  and the scope of the project itself. If necessary, create a rough map of each 
  of these parameters to understand your timeline.
</p>
<p>
  Templates for this will be provided in the Design Phase Operations Guide, but to start, 
  you can also modify the 
  <a href="https://github.com/labopm/HCD-Guides/blob/master/HCD_Ops_Guide_v12_spreads.pdf" target="_blank" title="Project Frame-Reframe template" class="usa-prose__hcd-guide_a hcd-guide__print_not_visible">Project Frame-Reframe template</a> 
  from pages 16-17 of the Discovery Operations Guide for this purpose. Map onto that template the following parameters:
</p>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_fullwidth">
  <p>
    What is the nature of your opportunity spaces? Are they big and conceptual? 
    Or smaller and tactical?
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you have a team with many conceptual skills? Or one with deep 
    technical knowledge?
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you have ready access to the stakeholders and participants, 
    or is access less well defined?
  </p>
</div>



<p>
  If the majority of these answers falls on the upper half of the Project Frame-Reframe template, 
  create a generous timeline for your Design phase. You&rsquo;ll need time to break down your 
  Opportunities into workable parts, to find partners with any technical skills you may 
  need and to get on the calendars of your stakeholders and participants.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, if all of your answers fall in the lower, more tactical region of the 
  Project Frame-Reframe template, you might consider expanding your Design Phase aim 
  to either take on a slightly larger, more strategic Opportunity space in order 
  to have more impact upon the Delivery of your product, service, or system.
