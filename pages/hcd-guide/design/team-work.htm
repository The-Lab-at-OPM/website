<h2>2.1. No solitary geniuses</h2>
<p>
  The myth of a solitary genius solving a huge problem no one else could solve is largely just that &mdash; a myth.
  Although CEOs, sports team leaders, and award-winners tend to get public credit, none of those people achieve their
  goals without the consistent, robust support and help of a variety of other people.

  The same holds true in design. Although design clusters around a few big names, like Frank Gehry, an architect,
  Jonathon Ive, an industrial designer at Apple, Inc, and Miuccia Prada, a fashion designer, all of these people have
  teams with which they work, and no of them designs in a vacuum. Working in teams allows organizations to utilize the
  unique backgrounds, training, and natural talents of a variety of people. In the same way that design teams go out and
  talk to participants during Discovery, they also work as teams that espouse multiple disciplines. This allows design
  teams to hear multiple points during the making phase, in the same way they heard multiple points of view during the
  Discovery phase.

    <h2>Interdisciplinary NASA teams</h2>
    <p>
      When the NASA undertook to land research robots called rovers on planet Mars, no one person accomplished the task.
      Not even one leader can take credit. Instead, to land and operate a rover successfully on Mars, NASA assembled
      multiple teams of flight and mechanical engineers, physicists, rocket scientists, designers, project managers,
      finance specialists, and others to take on the task.<img

<p>
  If you've heard the old saying &ldquo;it takes all kinds to make the world go &lsquo;round,&rdquo; then you know what
  this principle is about. Designing for those unlike yourselves depends on the practices of empathy. Practicing empathy
  means creating designs that will work for the participants.
</p>

<p>
  The word &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; is often used in the design circles to describe an ideal emotional state between
  designers and participants in which the designers have so deeply learned about the participants&rsquo; experience with
  a product, service, system, or lack thereof, that they can, as nearly as possible, stand in the shoes of the
  participants themselves. Practicing this emotional intelligence during the Design phase allows designers to create
  solutions for people whose experiences they may never have, but with whom they can empathize successfully codesign new
  or evolved products, services, and systems that improve participants&rsquo; future experiences.
</p>

<p>
  The team has practiced empathy throughout the Discovery phase during

    >Interviews</a
  >
  (Discovery Phase Concept Guide, pages 16 &mdash; 21). As you move deeper into design, remember that deep empathy or
  sympathy you developed. Lean on that while iterating in order to design for your participants, even if they are widely
  different from yourselves.

    <h2>VEO and Transitioning Veterans</h2>

      The

        title="VA Welcome Kit"
        class="usa-prose__hcd-guide_a hcd-guide__print_footnotes_link"
        >VA Welcome Kit</a
      >
      is one example of using empathy to design better experiences. Through hundreds of interviews with veterans,
      administrators, and service providers, the Veterans Experience Office has been able to organize these varied
      offerings, opportunities, and earned benefits into a single, well-designed informational package. Through
      intensive research with veterans and a value and practice of co-design during the Design phase, the Welcome Kit
      improves veterans' understanding of available services and benefits in the large VA system. Using plain language,
      the Kit strives to bring together the myriad phone numbers, registrations, and options a veteran has upon entering
      VA into a consistent, readable, and modern layout. To design it, VEO spent a year speaking and co-designing with
      veterans to understand and empathize with their confusion regarding benefits and services during transition.
      Building this empathy meant VEO sent employees and designers to all parts of the United States to talk to veterans
      about that experience. What this research found was that veterans bring a range of readiness for civilian life to
      their period of transition from the military, but that VA could do a lot better to smooth that path with
      consistent, consumable direction regarding the VA organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this information, the team designed the VA Welcome Kit, now in use across VA. The Welcome Kit research and
      design teams used empathy to engage with veterans about their experiences. The teams came to understand at a
      minute level veterans&rsquo; feelings of confusion and frustration with VA. The teams synthesize those learnings
      into the VA Welcome Kit and tested the product extensively with veterans across the country to ensure its utility.
      In this way, VEO stepped into the shoes of their product participants in order to improve their earliest
      experiences of VA. VA&rsquo;s Welcome Kit teams engaged empathetically with, not designed authoritatively for,
      veterans across the VA system.<img
