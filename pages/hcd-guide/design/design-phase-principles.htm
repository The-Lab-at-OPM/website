<p>
  The following explanations of the design principles should help you contextualize
  why the authors of this Guide have selected these principles as items to keep
  top-of-mind during your design phase. This section should also act as a reference
  throughout your design process.
</p>

<p>
  The following Global Design Phase principles are a high-level, project-type-agnostic
  means of defining Design-phase work. They allow us as designers and design teams
  to constantly align our designs to the needs and desires of our audience and are
  applicable across the fields for which we design in the Public Sector. The reason
  they are listed here is that, as teams create and iterate during the Design phase,
  they run the risk of losing touch with the urgency of the needs and values expressed
  by participants during the Discovery phase. Having a set of guiding principles gives
  design teams the parameters they need to constantly reference participants' needs
  and perspectives as the design phase proceeds.

  <h3>Global principles</h3>
  <p>
    Principles help teams maintain focus on their main objective while throughout a
    multi-parted, challenging design process. For this reason, design teams frequently
    create a set of guiding principles for their projects at the start of their Design Phase.
    These principles can be derived from the Opportunity spaces identified at the end of the
    Discovery phase. They encompass the main learnings from the participants in the Discovery phase;
    they are not tactical rules and guidance for the team.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__base_columns lab__base_column_right">
  <h3>Project-level principles</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to these global design principles, individual teams should create a set
    of guiding principles tailored to the specific project on which they&rsquo;re working.
    For example, if the design idea is to create a knowledge-sharing repository for a department,
    a principle of the design phase could be to center the design of the repository&rsquo;s
    submission structure on how the department members want to submit articles and notes,
    not how it would be easiest to build from a technical standpoint. Guidance on how
    to produce a set of principles for a design phase is forthcoming
    in the Design Phase Operations Guide.

  Below, find a set of global design principles. These principles, alongside those
  that you might create for your specific project, will help ensure that the designed
  product, service, or solution that your team develops embodies the perspectives and
  needs of your current and potential participants. These will be explained in detail
  in the following sections.
