  According to economists, services are items that are not manufactured and are typically delivered on-demand. They tend
  to be ongoing, or things you return to again and again, unlike the single-instance events that characterize products.
  The touchpoints of the transaction, the culture and community of the coffee shop, are components of the shop&rsquo;s
  service, which is ongoing and intangible. Going back to our coffee shop example, while the coffee you drink is a new
  product every day, the coffee shop provides the ongoing service of stocking, making, and selling coffee.

  As readers of this Guide probably already know, the public sector is, in fact, primarily a service provider. The
  services of governance, civil and criminal protections, environmental and food safety regulations, and so many others,
  are the primary reasons for the public sector&rsquo;s existence.

    <h2>Human-Centered Design Capacity Building</h2>
    <p>
      While the public sector provides many public-facing services, it also provides services to itself in many forms.
      One of those forms is that of education and capacity building for the workforce. An example of this type of
      service is The Lab at OPM and the Veterans Experience Office&rsquo;s (VEO&rsquo;s) Human-Centered Design (HCD)
      Capacity Building program, established in 2018.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program was a match between The Lab&rsquo;s mission to provide education and training to all levels of
      government as well as private sector professionals and VEO&rsquo;s increasing need for human-centered design
      capabilities.<img

  Since its establishment in 2015, VEO has relied almost exclusively on a combination of designs from The Lab at OPM and
  HCD contract resources to source expertise in applying HCD to solve complex problems. As the designated CX
  organization in VA, VEO seeks to increase its HCD capacity through this program to deepen VEO&rsquo;s understanding of
  Veteran needs and develop innovative tools and solutions to meet those needs. This program also an opportunity for VEO
  and The Lab at OPM to build an HCD capacity building program that could be leveraged by other Agencies in support of
  the President&rsquo;s Management Agenda (PMA), Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal of Improving Customer Experience with
  Federal Services. This program is designed to increase VEO&rsquo;s capacity to provide HCD support to VA and provide a
  framework for other Agencies to use as well.

<p>
  In this way, the HCD Capacity Building program is an example of a service that one agency (OPM) provides to another
  agency (VA). The exchange is comprised of knowledge and practice, and return on investment is long-term and strategic.
  Its evolution is ongoing, as there is no one-stop-shop for learning a complex practice like design. In order to
  support the participants&rsquo; development, however, The Lab has articulated a path to &ldquo;launch&rdquo;, ie,
  welcome into the public sector design community, that includes a variety of formal, class-based requirements as well
  as project-based evaluations.
