<p>
  To set you and your team up for success in the Design Phase, this Guide 
  is broken down into several parts. As was stated before, this Guide 
  focuses on the Why of each of these steps. Knowing the Why behind each 
  step will allow you to cross apply what you learn and practice in this 
  Guide into new projects as you continue in your career. These concepts include:

<h2 id="timeline">A note on timeline</h2>
<p>
  Each Design Phase differs depending on the nature of the product, service, or system, 
  the bandwidth and expertise of the team, access to the participants and stakeholders, 
  and the scope of the project itself. If necessary, create a rough map of each 
  of these parameters to understand your timeline.
</p>

<p>
  Templates for this will be provided in the Design Phase Operations Guide, but to start, 
  you can also modify the 
  <a href="https://github.com/labopm/HCD-Guides/blob/master/HCD_Ops_Guide_v12_spreads.pd" target="_blank" title="Project Frame-Reframe template" class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible">Project Frame-Reframe template</a> 
  from pages 16-17 of the Discovery Operations Guide for this purpose. Map onto that template the following parameters:
</p>

<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_fullwidth">
  <p>
    What is the nature of your opportunity spaces? Are they big and conceptual? 
    Or smaller and tactical?
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you have a team with many conceptual skills? Or one with deep 
    technical knowledge?
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you have ready access to the stakeholders and participants, 
    or is access less well defined?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  If the majority of these answers falls on the upper half of the Project Frame-Reframe template, 
  create a generous timeline for your Design phase. You&rsquo;ll need time to break down your 
  Opportunities into workable parts, to find partners with any technical skills you may 
  need and to get on the calendars of your stakeholders and participants.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, if all of your answers fall in the lower, more tactical region of the 
  Project Frame-Reframe template, you might consider expanding your Design Phase aim 
  to either take on a slightly larger, more strategic Opportunity space in order 
  to have more impact upon the Delivery of your product, service, or system.

<h1>Purpose of this guide</h1>

<p>
  The purpose of this Design Guide and its sister Design Phase Operations Guide (available Fall 2019) is not to make an exhaustive list of design 
  processes. There are many other works can do that for you, some of which we cite throughout this work. The purpose of this guide 
  is to provide context and some select methods for designing products, services, and systems that will help solve the problems 
  highlighted from your Discovery phase.
</p>

<p>
  While the Operations Guide will focus on the How of the making process, this Concept Guide helps you understand the 
  Why behind the How. After learning the Why, you will be able to cross-apply the contents of these Guides 
  to other situations and expanding your understanding of how to grapple with complex problems. Eventually, 
  you may find yourself able to contribute back to this work with original methods of your own making. 
  That, in fact, would be the author&rsquo;s and sponsors' greatest measure of success: for you to take 
  what you have learned here and create original work from your learnings.
</p>

<h2 id="participants">Participants</h2>
<p>
  Throughout this Guide, we will refer to the people for whom we&rsquo;re designing as participants. 
  This is because the people for whom we&rsquo;re designing are participating in the use 
  of the products, services, and systems we design. 
  They might participate by using our products, services, and systems in different ways 
  than we intended, adapting them to their own needs, or they might use them for a while 
  and abandon them. In this way, the participants have an active role in the life cycle 
  of our work. This approach is sometimes called Participatory Design; you can learn 
  about and practice it in detail in Participatory Design, one of 
  <a href="https://lab.opm.gov/class-sign-up/" title="and systems" target="_blank" class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible">the Lab&rsquo;s open enrollment classes</a>.

</div>
<div class="hcd-guide__print_wrapper">

<p>
  In contrast, thinking of participants as &ldquo;users&rdquo; or &ldquo;customers&rdquo; sidelines 
  them into simply receiving products, services, and systems. This creates either a supplicant 
  (i.e., please give me the thing or service) or an   entitled (e.g., I deserve the thing or service 
  without reservation and in the exact way I want it) orientation. This orientation separates and 
  creates a power imbalance between the leadership stakeholders sponsoring the work, 
  the design teams researching and creating the work, and participants contributing 
  their knowledge and voices to the work&rsquo;s development.
</p>

  
<p>
  In Human-Centered Design, both the designers 
  and the people for whom the designed products, services, and systems are made, participate 
  in the design, use, and evaluation processes. Participants are equal to the design team 
  and the leadership stakeholders, and the project as a whole is driven primarily 
  by participants' input. While the designers create the prototypes or models for solutions 
  to participant needs, they can only create and refine these products, services, and 
  systems through continued collaboration with the participants throughout the design process.
</p>

<h2 id="team-structure">A note on team structure</h2>
<p>
  The Design Phase team should include the team members from the Discovery Phase. 
  This team&rsquo;s in-depth understanding of the research as well as their practice in 
  working together will help to ensure a successful Design phase that results in a 
  useful, positive Delivery and Measure phase experience for the participants 
  and stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
  If someone from the Discovery Phase isn't available to join the Design Phase, 
  review the team structure you built based on the guidance on pages 22-31 in the 
  <a href="https://github.com/labopm/HCD-Guides/blob/master/HCD_Ops_Guide_v12_spreads.pdf" title="Discovery Phase Operations Guide" class="hcd-guide_print_not_visible" target="_blank">Discovery Phase Operations Guide</a> 
  and evaluate which piece you might be missing. More in-depth guidance on team roles for 
  the Design Phase will be provided in the upcoming Design Phase Operations 
  Guide (available Fall 2019).

<p>
  If your Design phase will almost certainly require technical expertise that your 
  Discovery team does not have, such as engineering, social work, or graphic design skills, 
  identify and recruit an available and sympathetic expert in that area as soon as possible. 
  By including this person in your core team before you start the design work itself, 
  the team will benefit from their input, and they will be able to invest more deeply 
  in the project than if they were brought in simply to realize your product, service, 
  or system vision.

<h1>Design Phase principles</h1>

<p>
  The following explanations of the design principles should help you contextualize 
  why the authors of this Guide have selected these principles as items to keep 
  top-of-mind during your design phase. This section should also act as a reference 
  throughout your design process.
</p>

<p>
  The following Global Design Phase principles are a high-level, project-type-agnostic 
  means of defining Design-phase work. They allow us as designers and design teams 
  to constantly align our designs to the needs and desires of our audience and are 
  applicable across the fields for which we design in the Public Sector. The reason 
  they are listed here is that, as teams create and iterate during the Design phase, 
  they run the risk of losing touch with the urgency of the needs and values expressed 
  by participants during the Discovery phase. Having a set of guiding principles gives 
  design teams the parameters they need to constantly reference participants' needs 
  and perspectives as the design phase proceeds.
</p>

<h2 id="design-phase-principles">Global Design Phase principles</h2>
<p>
  Below, find a set of global design principles. These principles, alongside those 
  that you might create for your specific project, will help ensure that the designed 
  product, service, or solution that your team develops embodies the perspectives and 
  needs of your current and potential participants. These will be explained in detail 
  in the following sections.

<h2>Why have design phase principles</h2>
<div class="lab__base_columns lab__base_column_left">
  <h3>Global principles</h3>
  <p>
    Principles help teams maintain focus on their main objective while throughout a 
    multi-parted, challenging design process. For this reason, design teams frequently 
    create a set of guiding principles for their projects at the start of their Design Phase. 
    These principles can be derived from the Opportunity spaces identified at the end of the 
    Discovery phase. They encompass the main learnings from the participants in the Discovery phase; 
    they are not tactical rules and guidance for the team.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__base_columns lab__base_column_right">
  <h3>Project-level principles</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to these global design principles, individual teams should create a set 
    of guiding principles tailored to the specific project on which they&rsquo;re working. 
    For example, if the design idea is to create a knowledge-sharing repository for a department, 
    a principle of the design phase could be to center the design of the repository&rsquo;s 
    submission structure on how the department members want to submit articles and notes, 
    not how it would be easiest to build from a technical standpoint. Guidance on how 
    to produce a set of principles for a design phase is forthcoming 
    in the Design Phase Operations Guide.

<h1>2. Team work</h1>

<h2>2.1. No solitary geniuses</h2>
<p>
  The myth of a solitary genius solving a huge problem no one else could solve is largely just 
  that &mdash; a myth. Although CEOs, sports team leaders, and award-winners tend to get 
  public credit, none of those people achieve their goals without the consistent, robust support 
  and help of a variety of other people.
</p>

<h2 id="making-decisions">Making decisions</h2>
<p>
  The same holds true in design. Although design clusters around a few big names, like 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry" title="Frank Gehry">Frank Gehry,</a> 
  an architect, 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive" title="Jonathon Ive">Jonathon Ive,</a> 
  an industrial designer at Apple, Inc, and 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miuccia_Prada" title="Miuccia Prada">Miuccia Prada,</a> 
  a fashion designer, all of these people have teams with which they work, and no 
  of them designs in a vacuum. Working in teams allows organizations to utilize 
  the unique backgrounds, training, and natural talents of a variety of people. 
  In the same way that design teams go out and talk to participants during Discovery, 
  they also work as teams that espouse multiple disciplines. This allows design teams 
  to hear multiple points during the making phase, in the same way they heard 
  multiple points of view during the Discovery phase.

    <h2>Interdisciplinary NASA teams</h2>
    <p>
      When the NASA undertook to land research robots called rovers on planet Mars, no one person 
      accomplished the task. Not even one leader can take credit. Instead, to land and operate 
      a rover successfully on Mars, NASA assembled multiple teams of flight and mechanical 
      engineers, physicists, rocket scientists, designers, project managers, finance specialists, 
      and others to take on the task.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h2>2.2 In their shoes</h2>
<p>
  If you've heard the old saying &ldquo;it takes all kinds to make the world go &lsquo;round,&rdquo; 
  then you know what this principle is about. Designing for those unlike yourselves depends 
  on the practices of empathy. Practicing empathy means creating designs that will work for 
  the participants.
</p>

<p>
  The word &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; is often used in the design circles to describe an ideal emotional 
  state between designers and participants in which the designers have so deeply learned 
  about the participants&rsquo; experience with a product, service, system, or lack thereof, 
  that they can, as nearly as possible, stand in the shoes of the participants themselves. 
  Practicing this emotional intelligence during the Design phase allows designers 
  to create solutions for people whose experiences they may never have, but with 
  whom they can empathize successfully codesign new or evolved products, services, 
  and systems that improve participants&rsquo; future experiences.
</p>

<p>
  The team has practiced empathy throughout the Discovery phase during 
  <a href="https://github.com/labopm/HCD-Guides/blob/master/HCD-Guide-Interagency-v1.5_spreads.pdf" title="Interviews" class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible">Interviews</a> 
  <sup class="hcd-guide__print_footnotes_link">1</sup> 
  (Discovery Phase Concept Guide, pages 16 &mdash; 21). As you move deeper into design, remember 
  that deep empathy or sympathy you developed. Lean on that while iterating in order 
  to design for your participants, even if they are widely different from yourselves.

    <h2>VEO and Transitioning Veterans</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="#" title="VA Welcome Kit">VA Welcome Kit</a> is one example 
      of using empathy to design better experiences. Through hundreds of interviews 
      with veterans, administrators, and service providers, the Veterans Experience Office 
      has been able to organize these varied offerings, opportunities, and earned benefits 
      into a single, well-designed informational package. Through intensive research with 
      veterans and a value and practice of co-design during the Design phase, the Welcome 
      Kit improves veterans' understanding of available services and benefits in the 
      large VA system. Using plain language, the Kit strives to bring together 
      the myriad phone numbers, registrations, and options a veteran has upon entering VA 
      into a consistent, readable, and modern layout. To design it, VEO spent a year speaking 
      and co-designing with veterans to understand and empathize with their confusion regarding 
      benefits and services during transition. Building this empathy meant VEO sent employees 
      and designers to all parts of the United States to talk to veterans about that experience. 
      What this research found was that veterans bring a range of readiness for civilian life 
      to their period of transition from the military, but that VA could do a lot better to smooth 
      that path with consistent, consumable direction regarding the VA organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this information, the team designed the VA Welcome Kit, now in use across VA. 
      The Welcome Kit research and design teams used empathy to engage with veterans about 
      their experiences. The teams came to understand at a minute level veterans&rsquo; feelings 
      of confusion and frustration with VA. The teams synthesize those learnings into the 
      VA Welcome Kit and tested the product extensively with veterans across the country 
      to ensure its utility. In this way, VEO stepped into the shoes of their product 
      participants in order to improve their earliest experiences of VA. VA&rsquo;s Welcome Kit 
      teams engaged empathetically with, not designed authoritatively for, veterans across 
      the VA system.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

  As they move through the design phase, teams need to evaluate how the proposed solution

  Teams can do this through talking with these impacted groups as the process goes on, 
  testing with them, and listening to anxieties about being expected to do more with no 
  more time allowances or, conversely, with being cut out of access or workflows they 
  may see as key to their work. Finding these participants might seem difficult, 
  but talk to your primary participants to find out who they think might be touched 
  by these changes, contact those groups, and set up testing with them.

    <h2>Scaling USPS</h2>
    <p>
      A well-designed product or service continues to be useful even as circumstances 
      around it may dramatically change. Back in 1775, the creators of the US Postal 
      Service could not foresee that delivery planes, trains, and trucks would one day 
      replace wagons and horses as the way of getting packages from here to there. 
      Technology has radically changed, but the core service offered by the US Post 
      Office remains relevant today, especially as the number of packages sent continues 
      to increase.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, much of the boom in online retail could not have occurred without 
      a reliable, low cost shipping infrastructure already in place. From small, 
      single-person shops to industry giants like Amazon, the US Postal Service&rsquo;s 
      package delivery has allowed businesses of all sizes to engage in digital 
      interactions that result in three dimensional goods showing up at customers&rsquo; 
      doors. This increase in scale, however, has not been without its challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the new services that characterize current package services, 
      like flat rate boxes and weekend delivery, cause a need for the consideration 
      and design for other changes within the USPS itself. For example, in the age 
      of Sunday delivery, how is personnel distributed and yet labor contracts still 
      honored? How might an unexpected glut of packages coming from one USPS site be 
      absorbed into the delivery system quickly and efficiently? Whenever a 
      public-facing feature is added, all these questions and many more have to be designed 
      for inside the organization. These are the types of changes that teams must consider 
      when creating new products, services, or systems in the context of large-scale 
      organizations. One change is rarely one change; in an organization of any size, 
      considering the potential changes to workflow, personnel, et cetera, that will 
      have to occur to support a new or evolved system is a crucial task 
      of the design team.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h2>3.2 Value new participants</h2>
<p>
  Your design does not exist in a vacuum. It will be integrated into an ecosystem 
  of processes, all of which have their primary participants and stakeholders. 
  For this reason, it is important to understand and anticipate the role of new 
  participants in the your proposed designs.
</p>

<p>
  New participants are people who are entirely fresh to the process, either 
  from the public or from inside the organization. When the team is creating 
  an entirely new product to offer to veterans, or a new system for school 
  administrators to talk to one another, then everyone will be a new participant. 
  Keep in mind, however, that new participants also come from inside the organization. 
  Whoever will distribute or administer that new product is a new participant. 
  Introductions, training, and a consideration of their current workload will 
  all need to be addressed.

    <h2>Thinking of participants: the USAJOBS redesign</h2>
    <p>
      The USA Jobs website is well-known to many federal employees. Through 
      this jobs application portal, one can find a position that fits with 
      a desired career path, background, employment preference, and General 
      Services level. In the past, this site has been run by the federal 
      government as well as by private entities, but it has never gotten 
      good reviews, either from new or experienced participants, in terms 
      of experience or usability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Navigating the site required participants to understand multiple points 
      about their employment opportunities that they might only know if they 
      had already had experience with federal employment. Even if applicants 
      did have previous understanding of the federal hiring system, the site&rsquo;s 
      structure made it almost impossible to understand if they had successfully 
      applied for a job or not. Applicants had no visibility into where their 
      application was in the hiring process. In addition, unless someone 
      explicitly reached out to them, they had no way of knowing whether their 
      application was still moving through the system or if they had been 
      dropped from consideration.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These pain points were considered during the massive redesign of the site 
      from 2015-2018. Although still reflective of a maddeningly byzantine hiring 
      path, both applicants and hiring managers are now able to interact through 
      a more modern, transparent system. This improvement was made possible by 
      constant testing both with new and experienced participants as alternations 
      to the site design were proposed and built. No feature of this site appeared 
      to the public without hearing from participants about their experience with it. 
      This sort of large-scale change is possible only through a long-term commitment 
      to change that is paired with a constant return to focus on the participants themselves.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h1>4. Design at scale</h1>

<h2>4.1 Plan for long-term use</h2>

<h3>Differences in need</h3>
<p>
  Design in the Public Sector can seem a slower, more complicated affair than 
  its Private Sector counterpart. However, each sector has its own unique values 
  and pressures, terms to fulfill, and spaces to explore. While the Private Sector 
  is pressured by a constant need for increasing profit and the short-term thinking 
  that such a challenge requires, the Public Sector must respond to and support 
  the public through the long life spans we now enjoy, which means nurturing ideas 
  that support planning ahead for decades of growth and change.

    <h2>Building resilient buildings: the New Orleans VA Medical Center</h2>
    <p>
      In talking about New Orleans, one cannot avoid talking about Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
      The citizens of that famous city speak of &ldquo;before the storm&rdquo; 
      and &ldquo;after the storm&rdquo; as markers of time and radical change. Katrina 
      flooded the 50-year-old VA Medical Center (VAMC) in New Orleans, ultimately shutting 
      it down and causing suffering to some of the city&rsquo;s most vulnerable residents.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2016, the city reopened its VA Medical Center. In building this new facility, VA and 
      its partners chose to plan for more storms like Katrina, instead of chalking 
      it up on a once-in-a-century event. In order to plan for other violent storms 
      and flooding even, the building features bed capacity for housing people through 
      electrical outages and has a boat landing on the second floor. The planners anticipated 
      that the building might be in use for another 50 years, and that those 50 years are full 
      of unknowns. The result is a facility that works not only for the current healthcare 
      of the approximately 70,000 veterans in the Gulf Coast region, but also the community 
      surrounding the facility itself and that community&rsquo;s potential, critical needs.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h2 id="public-sector-design">4.2 Public sector design</h2>
<p>
  Public Sector Design means planning for all groups affected by the products, services, 
  and systems we design. It is also inherent to our work that we make sure that groups of 
  differing abilities, backgrounds, worldviews, ages, and practices are all able to access 
  what Public Sector designers create. This means that the groups needed for research and 
  testing are massive, but that need must be addressed if we want to be sure that our designs 
  are useful and usable.
</p>

<h3 id="precision">Precision; not exclusion</h3>
<p>
  This process can be anxiety-inducing, as it means the design won&rsquo;t meet all the needs of all 
  the participants. This decision-making is, however, necessary. What a design team is trying 
  to do is to make a precisely useful solution for a precise problem, not to make a large, unwieldly solution 
  that tries (and fails) to solve all the problems encountered by the participants.

    <h2>VA&rsquo;s Patient Advocacy Tracking System (PATS)</h2>
    <p>
      The Patient Advocacy Tracking System (PATS) is not a glamorous software product. At its core, 
      it is a data-entry system used by Patient Advocates, who are non-clinical service providers 
      in VA Medical Centers. But its function is incredibly important: to record complaints 
      and compliments veterans have while navigating VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and to track 
      the paths to their resolutions and the paths of compliments through to their dissemination. 
      The numbers generated by the PATS system are vital to the medical centers as a dataset, but 
      those numbers, configured in various ways, return different results according to the audience&rsquo;s 
      values, assumptions and biases. For example, administrators use PATS to track performance; 
      medical professionals use PATS to gather insights into how veterans and caregivers perceive 
      their care, and Patient Advocates themselves, who are charged with keeping all the numbers 
      on the reactions of veterans to their care. Given this diverse group, should the software 
      attempt to answer all their questions and needs, or should it focus on working best 
      for one set of participants? And, if for one set, whose values should be most supported 
      in a redesign?
    </p>

    <p>
      In preparing for just such a redesign, the Veterans Experience Office and The Lab partnered 
      to parse the data and define the audience. While part of the redesign effort was supposed 
      to include an expansion of the resolution process to the different medical departments, 
      also known as Service Lines, within a VA hospital, the research undertaken by VEO 
      and The Lab showed that those service lines would not necessarily be able to take 
      on this task in addition to their normal medical work. In response to this research, 
      the team decided to design the system for the needs of the Patient Advocates themselves, 
      because they touch the system most often and would, according to the research, would continue 
      to manage the resolution process, and were willing to work more closely with the medical lines 
      to enact the new procedures as needed in the future.
    </p>

    <p class="hcd-guide__print_hide_element">
      For this reason, the software interface The Lab designed focuses on the needs of the Patient Advocates 
      in their daily work: a large, open text box for notes; search by name and last four digits 
      of social security numbers, and the ability to have multiple cases open at the same time. 
      While the system will still allow healthcare providers to access complaints and compliments 
      and be part of the process, and it will still allow administrators to pull performance numbers, 
      it answers the needs of the audience that interacts with it most often - the Patient Advocates. 
      Because of this, the design team chose the Patient Advocates as the primary design audience 
      for this work. The system would allow other audiences to get what they need from the system, 
      but the system is designed primarily around Patient Advocates' needs, as the primary participants 
      in it. In this way, the PATS redesign is an example of supporting multiple participants, 
      but highly defining one&rsquo;s primary audience.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h1>5. Design for change</h1>

<p>
  The Design phase requires much energy and effort in order to reach 
  the goal of usable products, services, and systems. It sometimes seems 
  as though teams must make all the right decisions or get everything perfect 
  before launch is possible. It&rsquo;s important to remember that no design is 
  permanent; everything will need to change, will have to flex, and will 
  ultimately be succeeded by something that is hopefully more useful and 
  more delightful than the thing originally designed. To prepare for this 
  and to build in space for flexibility and change, many design teams work 
  as though they are always in an iterative loop: constantly designing, 
  testing, delivering, and measuring designs they know aren&rsquo;t perfect but 
  are getting closer and closer to a perceived ideal. This state can last 
  months or even years, and setting up designs to undergo it is an important 
  part of the Design Phase process.
</p>

<h2 id="right-opportunity">5.1 Wait for the Right Opportunity</h2>
<p>
  As was said before, the design phase is about making decisions. Almost 
  always you will find yourself having to leave behind what you and the 
  team are certain are desirable, feasible design ideas in order to pursue 
  one of those ideas that is more desirable or feasible. This can feel difficult. 
  You might even feel as if you are not fulfilling the needs of your participants, 
  and therefore not fulfilling your project mandate, because you are 
  not meeting all their needs.
</p>

<p>
  Good ideas, based on strong research, however, have a long shelf life. Better 
  than trying to execute on all the ideas your team has come up with, focus in 
  on the one that you can do well and thoroughly, and wait for the right opportunity 
  to execute on one or some of the others. Note all your design ideas in your project
  documentation, outlining their connection to your research. If possible, share them 
  with other teams who might be able to design for them. But avoid taking 
  on the development of more than one design idea at a time. Your project has 
  a greater potential for success if you allow the team to focus on developing designs 
  for a single idea.
</p>

</div>
<div class="hcd-guide__print_wrapper hcd-guide__print_one_column">

<p>
  Once the initial design phase is complete, the team can always go back 
  to the additional ideas. If the research was done thoroughly and 
  with excellent documentation, those ideas will almost certainly still be pertinent. 
  You might even be able to update them, given the work you have done 
  in your first design phase. And in the meantime, circumstances might have developed 
  that create opportunities for design ideas that might have previously not been feasible 
  to now be more realistic. In this way, for the good of your design phase, focus 
  on the design ideas you can most reasonably execute immediately, never leaving behind 
  your other ideas, but putting them on the back burner until you either have time, 
  resources, or a better opportunity to address them.

    <h2>Veteran suicide prevention</h2>
    <p>
      In 2017, the Veterans Experience Office undertook a focused project in rural, upstate New 
      York to try to understand and address the issue of suicide among rural veterans. A team 
      of four VEO people and a Lab team member worked for months to connect with private 
      and VA healthcare providers and Veteran Service Organizations in addition to local, 
      county, and state organizations in order to understand the nature of veteran suicide 
      in the area and what was being done to prevent it. In August of 2017, the team presented 
      its findings to both the VA&rsquo;s Office of Suicide Prevention as well as to leaders 
      in the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 2, which covers New York and New Jersey.
    </p>

    <p>
      The team provided multiple design ideas that could be pursued to forward the work 
      already being done in VISN 2 and to scale the best practices from the area 
      to other rural areas experiencing similar veteran suicide crises. The solutions 
      were divided into two groups, Immediately Actionables and Need More Research, 
      to give VEO leadership an idea of how the team might proceed immediately and 
      in the medium term. Disappointingly, the team did not get the go-ahead to pursue 
      their Immediately Actionables, and the design phase seemed to whither. 
      In the face of the VEO reorganization, the team was broken up into different areas 
      of specialty, and the discovery research seemed destined to gather dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      The research, however, was rigorous and sound. A calendar year later, the Centers 
      for Disease Control (CDC) approached The Lab with an audacious idea: apply 
      Human-Centered Design to the problem of suicide among veterans who do not access 
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare. Suddenly, the research 
      from that New York State project had new life. It became part of the literature review 
      for the CDC&rsquo;s project. The Immediately Actionables shed light on the needs 
      of healthcare providers in rural areas specifically, while the Needs More Research ideas 
      fed into the direction of the CDC Discovery Phase.

<h2 id="life-cycle">5.2 Designs have a life cycle</h2>
<p>
  Creating new work and sharing it with the world is exciting (and frightening); 
  that is doubtless. Through the long, hard Discovery Phase, through all the meetings 
  where the team had to “sell” their vision, through all the emails flying back 
  and forth between the design and implementation teams, a lot of work goes 
  into realizing a new product, service, or system. There is a pride, an irrecoverable cost, 
  and an emotional association inherent to a designed thing, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the thing 
  has to continue to be owned or exercised by the original team or department that created it.
</p>

<p>
  Products, services, and systems have life cycles, both natural and imposed, usually relative 
  to the amount of time that it takes to build a thing. This idea might feel odd or painful. 
  After all, why go through all the work getting your work into the world if you&rsquo;re already 
  thinking of how it might exit it? We are not taught how to do this; as organizations, 
  we largely do not talk about letting go or taking apart. Instead, when designed products, systems, 
  or services become dysfunctional, we often blame the people who administer them, 
  or we argue that the dysfunction is simply how things are. However, these are not usually accurate reasons; 
  they are ways to avoid the potential pain of change. Humans fight change; it feels dangerous. 
  Not changing, however, holds us back. For this reason, rather than fight natural life cycles, 
  organizations should strive to acknowledge them and move with them.

    <h2>Consumer Financial Protection Agency: policy sunsets</h2>
    <p>
      As a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPB, established 2011) took 
      on the massive task of regulating various types of financial entities in the United States. 
      As they scaled quickly, the leadership of CFPB&rsquo;s Human Capital (Human Resources) office 
      understood that, in the rush of bringing on personnel to address such a broad mission, 
      human capital policies ran the risk of being put into place but never implemented. 
      This might not be because the policies themselves were not good ideas, but, instead, 
      because their intended purpose could have been either subsumed by another, adjacent policy, 
      because the policy did not, in fact, mesh with related policies, or because supportive 
      policies were not pursued.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, the Human Capital leadership instituted a &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; rule: any policy 
      that had not been implemented within two years of its articulation would be sunset, or dropped, 
      from the agency&rsquo;s policy books. The assumption was that any policy that had not gained traction 
      in that time was clearly pretty unnecessary to some people. In this way, CFPB&rsquo;s Human Capital 
      office understood that not all their policy design ideas would necessarily take root, and, 
      in response, built in an automatic means by which to set those policies aside.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is clear thinking, although it might seem a bit sad. However, if a solution does not 
      take root, becomes outdated, or is superseded by another solution, that doesn't mean 
      that the effort going into creating that solution was necessarily wasted. Rather, 
      it means that something has been learned about why things change, about what might cause an 
      idea to not take root, about how and when ideas become outdated, as well as about the 
      natural progression and nature of change, and when and how to allow one idea to supersede 
      another. Instead of keeping design solutions around indefinitely, a better practice is 
      to build in an automatic cycle of re-evaluation for them, so they can be updated if they can 
      and need to be, or they can be sunset, with the reasons why they no longer function becoming 
      part of the knowledge base for new designs.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h1>Designed Things</h1>

<p>
  It&rsquo;s easy to believe that the thing a design team makes is, in fact, the &ldquo;design". 
  However, the thing that the team makes is simply a physical expression of the nuanced, 
  well-informed, and carefully constructed design ideas that the team has formed through 
  the process of Discovery and Design. In other words, it&rsquo;s exciting to create new things 
  from the research you have enacted, and to test that thing with participants, and launch 
  it into the world, but that thing must adhere to needs found in Discovery 
  and be constrained by the Opportunities found during Synthesis.
</p>

<p>
  Whatever the Opportunities your team identified, in the public sector, you will most 
  likely design a product, service, system, or a pantheon of those items. This product, 
  service, or system is the expression of your design ideas. Drawing from your design 
  ideas, defining what the item you will design, or what items to design in what order, 
  is a crucial decision. To help you parse your options, this section provides a broad 
  outline of the ways in which products, services, and systems differ. It also highlights 
  a few of the points at which products and services specifically are dependent upon 
  each other and where and how the two might intertwine.
</p>

<p>
  The National Archives provides some useful guidelines for differentiating 
  between product and service from the viewpoint of the participant (or client, 
  in their wording) in &ldquo;Defining Key Concepts: Products vs. Services&rdquo; article. 
  They say that:
</p>

<div class="lab-cta__quote">
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    &ldquo;One way to think of [products and services] is from the clients&rsquo; point of view. 
    When a client asks  &ldquo;what can you make for me?&rdquo; they are asking about products; 
    when a client asks  &ldquo;what can you do for me?&rdquo; they are asking about services. While 
    a product is something that can be measured and counted, a service is less concrete 
    and is the result of the application of skills and expertise towards an identified need.&rdquo;
  </blockquote>

<p>
  As you read through this section, consider your Opportunities through the lens of product 
  versus service versus system. Do some of them speak to being expressed as one of these 
  designed things? Might some of their possible designed outcomes be a combination? Is it 
  still unclear for some?

<p>

  Products are defined by economists as made, or manufactured, objects, typically created 
  in a factory setting. They tend to be single-instance interactions between buyer and seller. 
  If you go to a coffee shop and buy a coffee every day, each purchase of that coffee 
  is a new event; the coffee is the product, and the product is new every time you buy it.
</p>

<p>
  More broadly than the 
  <a href="https://hcd-design-phase-concept-guide.netlify.com/productsservices.html" title="National Archives&rsquo; definition" class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible">National Archives&rsquo; definition</a> 
  <sup class="hcd-guide__print_footnotes_link">1</sup> 
  highlighted in the previous section, 
  economists as a group define products quite literally as something you &ldquo;can drop on your foot&rdquo;, 
  and they&rsquo;re not joking. This definition, while appropriate, does not address some 
  of the most important current products we interact with every day: digital products.
</p>

<h2 id="products-service">Products-service spectrum</h2>
<p>
  Like the coffee and coffee shop example above, many products and services coexist and serve each other 
  as different parts of systems. Before further exploring the relationship between these two concepts, 
  we can further break products into two broad categories: tangible or traditional products, and digital products.
</p>

<div class="lab__base_columns lab__base_column_left">
  <h4>Tangible Products</h4>

  <p>
    <b>Tangible products</b> are the traditional playing field of design. They are what 
    most people think of when they think of design in general. Tangible products 
    require manufacturing in some way, and can be used in three dimensional space.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the private sector, they include daily items like coffee cups, while 
    in the public sector they can be items like driver&rsquo;s licenses and passports.

<h2>Products &amp; services work together</h2>
<p>
  In order to be able to determine whether a product, service, or a combination 
  of the two might be necessary for the project at hand, it&rsquo;s important to be able 
  to recognize and categorize some of these interactions. In parsing different 
  product-service interactions in the public sector, the authors of this Guide 
  have come up with three categories: products that set constraints around categories, 
  products that give access to services, and products that augment services. Find a 
  brief description of each of them with private and public sector examples below.
</p>

<p>
  Products like these are used to box in a service so that consumers can use 
  it in pieces or at certain scales. In the private sector, they include items 
  like insurance, which box in insurance services to include a certain package 
  of services on offer at a certain price point. In the public sector, they include 
  things like drivers&rsquo; licenses classifications. The service of licensing drivers 
  is the umbrella offering; the classifications allow people to use that service 
  at different levels. For example, CDL drivers are licensed to pilot vehicles over 
  a certain number of axles or a certain weight, while a class C license limits 
  the driver to smaller vehicles.

</div>
  
<div class="hcd-guide__print_wrapper">

<p>
  Products like these are necessary to access services. Private sector examples 
  include video streaming interfaces: without the interface, the video streaming 
  service might exist, but no one would be able to access it. A good public sector 
  example is New York City&rsquo;s 311 service, which exists as a call center that routes 
  calls as well as a mobile app. Without the product of the phone line or the app, 
  New York City might offer services for non-emergencies, but New Yorkers would 
  not be able to access them.
</p>

<p>
  Products that augment a service are not necessarily needed to constrain 
  or access the service, but they do make using the service more delightful 
  or easy. A private sector example is a to-go coffee cup: while coffee can 
  always be served in multiple-use cups, to-go cups, whether multiple 
  or single use, create a different way to use a coffee service. A public 
  sector example includes the Welcome Kit from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
  mentioned in the 
  <a href="/hcd-guide/design/team-work.htm" title="&ldquo;In their shoes&rdquo; Design Phase principle">&ldquo;In their shoes&rdquo; Design Phase principle</a> 
  previously. While the Welcome Kit is not strictly necessary 
  for accessing all of VA&rsquo;s services   and benefits, it certainly makes 
  those services and benefits easier, more delightful, and is shaping up 
  to show higher rates of navigation success for veterans entering the VA system.

<h1>Services</h1>

<p>
  According to economists, services are items that are not manufactured and are 
  typically delivered on-demand. They tend to be ongoing, or things you return 
  to again and again, unlike the single-instance events that characterize products. 
  The touchpoints of the transaction, the culture and community of the coffee shop, 
  are components of the shop&rsquo;s service, which is ongoing and intangible. Going back 
  to our coffee shop example, while the coffee you drink is a new product every day, 
  the coffee shop provides the ongoing service of stocking, making, and selling coffee.
</p>

<p>
  As readers of this Guide probably already know, the public sector is, in fact, primarily 
  a service provider. The services of governance, civil and criminal protections, environmental 
  and food safety regulations, and so many others, are the primary reasons 
  for the public sector&rsquo;s existence.

    <h2>Human-Centered Design Capacity Building</h2>
    <p>
      While the public sector provides many public-facing services, it also provides 
      services to itself in many forms. One of those forms is that of education 
      and capacity building for the workforce. An example of this type of service 
      is The Lab at OPM and the Veterans Experience Office&rsquo;s (VEO&rsquo;s) Human-Centered 
      Design (HCD) Capacity Building program, established in 2018.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This program was a match between The Lab&rsquo;s mission to provide education 
      and training to all levels of government as well as private sector professionals 
      and VEO&rsquo;s increasing need for human-centered design capabilities.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

  <div class="hcd-guide__print_page_num_title">HCD Design Phase Concept Guide</div>
</div>
<div class="hcd-guide__print_wrapper">

<p>
  Since its establishment in 2015, VEO has relied almost exclusively on a combination 
  of designs from The Lab at OPM and HCD contract resources to source expertise 
  in applying HCD to solve complex problems. As the designated CX organization 
  in VA, VEO seeks to increase its HCD capacity through this program to deepen 
  VEO&rsquo;s understanding of Veteran needs and develop innovative tools and solutions 
  to meet those needs. This program also an opportunity for VEO and The Lab at OPM 
  to build an HCD capacity building program that could be leveraged by other Agencies 
  in support of the President&rsquo;s Management Agenda (PMA), Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) 
  Goal of Improving Customer Experience with Federal Services. This program is designed 
  to increase VEO&rsquo;s capacity to provide HCD support to VA and provide a framework for 
  other Agencies to use as well.
</p>

<p>
  In this way, the HCD Capacity Building program is an example of a service 
  that one agency (OPM) provides to another agency (VA). The exchange is comprised 
  of knowledge and practice, and return on investment is long-term and strategic. 
  Its evolution is ongoing, as there is no one-stop-shop for learning a complex 
  practice like design. In order to support the participants&rsquo; development, however, 
  The Lab has articulated a path to &ldquo;launch&rdquo;, ie, welcome into the public sector 
  design community, that includes a variety of formal, class-based requirements as 
  well as project-based evaluations.

<h1>Systems</h1>

<p>
  Economists divide economies into the two previous categories of activity: 
  manufacturing products, and executing services. This parsing is not quite precise 
  enough for the challenges of design, however. In the design process, we have a 
  third possible category of designed thing: <b>systems.</b>
</p>

<p>
  As was said at the introduction to this section, the public sector 
  is primarily a service provider. Those services are upheld, augmented, 
  and accessed through products. But, especially internally, the public 
  sector also launches and maintains systems that, while not exactly services 
  themselves, are also not exactly products. Systems differ from services 
  in that they, too, uphold services, or even launch the products, 
  but they are neither. One example of this is the hiring system through 
  which the public can enter the government workforce. The website 
  <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/" title="USAJobs.gov" class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible" target="_blank">USAJobs.gov</a>
  <sup class="hcd-guide__print_footnotes_link">1</sup>
  is a product that creates access to the hiring system. 
  The action of hiring itself is a service, while the process of getting hired is, 
  in fact a system supporting that service. In this way, the hiring managers, 
  people who write position descriptions, review resumes, conduct background checks, 
  et cetera, are parts of the hiring system, which, as a whole is the service 
  to the American public of hiring.

    <h2>USAJOBS Mission Critical Hiring Paths diagram</h2>
    <p>
      Teams rebuilding the outdated USAJOBS site studied the interactions of 
      USAJOBS.gov product and the system of hiring closely. Instead of simply 
      overhauling the site from technical, administrative, public-, or 
      organizational-facing perspectives, the design team brought all these groups 
      to the table during the design process. Each group has a unique value 
      and requirements set for the functioning of the site, and, in organizing 
      that functionality, those values and needs must be balanced. For example, 
      if the designers prioritize technology needs, they might ignore the needs 
      of the people who process the information coming in. If they prioritize 
      administrators&rsquo; needs, they might not reflect the needs of the public. 
      Even though each of these groups is working towards the same goal, the successful

    <p>
      For this reason, throughout their project&rsquo;s development, the designers mapped 
      how the system of hiring worked, where it bogged down, and how it might be 
      reconstructed. They recognized that the hiring system drives every aspect 
      of the sites&rsquo; functionality, no matter which group a participant 
      or stakeholder might come from. In this way, the effort to improve the USAJOBS 
      site became an effort to improve hiring itself, thusly demonstrating the utility 
      of finding and working from the root cause of an issue, instead of solving for 
      discreet, surface issues.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h1>Envisioning Ideas</h1>

<p>
  The Design phase is all about creation. To aid idea expression and development, designers 
  use non-verbal and non-text-based communication to show their ideas and thoughts 
  in addition to talking and/or writing about them. We use these because it can be difficult 
  to express the fullness of ideas verbally or in text, especially collaboratively, 
  when the idea is still emerging, vague, or unfinished.
</p>

<p>
  That being said, alternatives to verbal and text-based communication channels, 
  like drawing, collaging, or model-making, aren't better than verbal- and 
  text-based communications; they&rsquo;re all different from one another and can 
  be used in unison.
</p>

<p>
  Each communication method answers a specific set of needs, according 
  to the strength of that method. If talking about the changes you&rsquo;re thinking 
  of making to an existing system is confusing, why not draw it? If you can't 
  really describe a better visual-impairment melody for a system to play 
  when people log in, why not hum two or three options, record it on your phone, 
  and email that instead?
</p>

<p>
  You might feel silly at the time you&rsquo;re making the drawing or recordings, 
  but your team will understand what you&rsquo;re thinking faster, and you'll be 
  able to more forward on the project rapidly. In this way, drawing, building, 
  collaging, and/or recording our ideas is faster, more clear, and more actionable 
  than just talking or writing about them.
</p>

<h4>Show & Tell in the design process:</h4>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_fullwidth">
  <p>
    Showing as well as telling allows vague or complex ideas can start 
    to take shape rapidly. These concrete items, like drawings, models, 
    or recordings, retain their shape while words fly about and sometimes 
    get lost, forgotten, or misunderstood.
  </p>
  <p>
    Making a collage, a drawing, or building a model of an idea brings 
    the idea away from the individual into a stand-alone space so that 
    it can be evaluated without attaching evaluation to the individual.
  </p>
  <p>
    By layering showing and telling, designers can communicate more 
    complexity than if they stayed with either showing or telling.

<h2 id="abstract-concepts">Communicating abstract concepts</h2>
<p>
  When design teams need to talk about abstract concepts or convey a feeling, 
  they often use any of those alternate forms of communication to do so. 
  These photos, drawings, recordings, et cetera, are called &ldquo;references&rdquo; 
  because you should &ldquo;reference&rdquo; them when reading the text or listening 
  to the presentation that accompanies them. They function the same way that metaphors 
  and similes do in written and verbal language. Instead of saying &ldquo;happy&rdquo; 
  and expecting everyone to know what we mean, we often say things like 
  &ldquo;happy, like a sunny day&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
  In design, we bring our metaphors into visual, audio, and tactile forms so that we 
  can communicate meaning, form, and emotion all in one place.
</p>
    
<h3 id="communicating-happiness">Using references: communicating happiness</h3>
<p>
  In this example, a team member would like to describe a product or service 
  that should have a happy, sunny feeling. To do this, the team member has 
  collected images to help them communicate what they mean when they talk 
  about a happy, sunny feeling.
</p>
  
<p>
  As you can see, none of the images in this section are actually images 
  of &ldquo;happy&rdquo;. One is a line drawing of two people talking to each other 
  with stars around them. One is a logo that uses a sun-like form that seems like 
  it might be quite happy and optimistic. The third is actually the words 
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking on sunshine&rdquo;, but in a font that looks happy and fat, sort of like 
  it&rsquo;s written in toothpaste. And the fourth is a photo of a beach on a sunny day, 
  which many people associate with happiness.
</p>

<p>
  So none of these images are actually images of happiness, and none of them 
  is particularly sophisticated. In fact, they look homemade or pulled off 
  the internet. And that&rsquo;s part of the point: references shouldn&rsquo;t be polished; 
  they&rsquo;re a quick way to communicate your thoughts, not your final presentation. 
  But what is a picture of happiness, and how could your final idea be just 
  &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;? First, there isn&rsquo;t one picture of happiness, 
  because it&rsquo;s different for all of us, and secondly, this is not the 
  time to have a final idea; you&rsquo;re still envisioning and communicating 
  your first draft ideas. This is why using references is so useful when talking 
  about abstract concepts like happiness and when working at the early stages 
  of your design phase.
</p>

<h3 id="show-and-tell">Using references is just Show and Tell</h3>
<p>
  In grade school, many students in the United States play an in-classroom game 
  called &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;. In this exercise, students bring in an object they think 
  is interesting, show it to the class, and then tell the class a story for which 
  that object is starting point or an integral part.
</p>

<p>
  One of the purposes of this exercise is to teach students about how tangible objects 
  can represent abstract concepts or events that have already occurred.
</p>

<p>
  For example, although a student cannot bring to class the hike in the woods they 
  took over the weekend, they can bring the cool rock they picked up on that hike 
  as a representation of what they did. By connecting the tangible rocks with the 
  intangible hike, students are able to make generalizable connections about the elements 
  of a hike, where to find rocks, and what future hikes or rocks might be like.

<p>
  As adults, images and objects function in the same way: an object or visualization 
  allows us to give shapes to ideas. From that starting point, we can then talk 
  about a desired experience, substance, process, etc. that cannot be present. 
  For this reason, the old game of show and tell as useful in meetings as it was 
  in your grade school&rsquo;s class.
</p>

<p>
  Important to Note: Understand that different cultures assign different meanings 
  to shapes, colors, gestural forms, and groupings, the same way different parts 
  of the US assign different meanings to words (try ordering a pop in a restaurant 
  in the South. No one will know what you&rsquo;re talking about.) For this reason, 
  if the design work is to be shared across languages or cultures, some research 
  is required to ensure that the work retains the intended impact across all audiences.

<h1>Building out ideas</h1>

<h2>Using collections of references for ideation</h2>
<p>
  As design teams begin to ideate, they start to create collections of references, 
  often called Reference Decks, to help show their ideas. By accompanying these 
  collections of references with words, whether written or verbal, the team can 
  more easily understand what it collectively is thinking or what an individual 
  teammate is thinking, keep a record of that thinking, and edit the idea.
</p>

<p>
  Because design teams evolve or create new products, services, or systems, there&rsquo;s 
  no exact photo or sketch or recording of it that exists. For this reason, it&rsquo;s 
  essential to develop a collection of references that are like the product, service, 
  or system you&rsquo;re envisioning in order to express all your thoughts on how a design 
  might look, feel, and function. The purpose of using references, whether drawn, 
  photographed, recorded, et cetera, is to meet four primary goals:
</p>

<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_fullwidth">
  <p>
    To explore nuances in a proposal, system, or idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand those nuances.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify those nuances, especially if they act within a complex system.
  </p>
  <p>
    To communicate the steps above to others who may or may not be present in design meetings.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="when-references">When to use references</h2>
<p>
  Design team members can use references to aid in communication with their teammates 
  at any point in the design process. However, since references inform the direction 
  of an idea&rsquo;s designed form, and not the details of that form itself, they are most 
  frequently used early in the process of making a prototype design solution. If the 
  team finds itself still leaning on references as they approach a low-fidelity prototype 
  that&rsquo;s testable in the field, that can be a marker of a team that is not coalescing 
  around a design direction, and thusly the team needs to back up and start the design 
  process from the idea again.

  If these four images were a teammate&rsquo;s reference deck, what might be a few ideas

  from work, in a light-hearted environment such as community engagement 
  or outdoor exercise opportunities for veterans or school children. Because this is 
  only an example, one might take away many ideas from it. For a more precise understanding 
  of the idea, the reference deck would need to be built out more fully, preferably 
  accompanied by verbal or written cues as well.

<h1>Iteration</h1>

<h2>Everyone iterates at different points in their work</h2>

<p>
  Most people, in any profession, iterate constantly: they just define the iterations they&rsquo;re 
  making in terms of their immediate outputs, whether those are emails or processes or 
  methods, instead of their strategic goals. In design iteration, teams use iterations 
  as a way to approach the strategic goals of the project as well as fulfill 
  the immediate goals of it.
</p>

<p>
  To understand iteration at the immediate, daily level, think about emails. Any email 
  that requires a bit of thought, whether it&rsquo;s for work or a personal matter, requires 
  iteration. When we write thoughtful emails, we think about what to say. We try out 
  wording, delete words, and move things around until we think we have expressed in the 
  best way what we want to say. Then we send it. All those different email versions were 
  iterations of the email. They weren&rsquo;t the email&rsquo;s final form; they 
  weren&rsquo;t even the second or the third. They were many versions that had 
  to be made in order to reach a version that seemed to be the most clear, best way 
  to say what needed to be said.

      Tangrams are dissection puzzles consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, 
      which are put together to form shapes. Since a tangram puzzle allows us 
      to create many shapes out of the same component parts, they represent 
      a useful parallel to solving a design problem. If these tangram puzzles 
      were actual design solutions, they would reflect the similarities 
      of their origins while illustrating the process of iterating on ideas.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  The tangrams in the Fields of Opportunity are stand-ins for an iterative design process. Why tangrams? 
  Because a tangram puzzle is a useful way to talk about the cycle of ideation and iteration during the 
  design phase. Every tangram is comprised of the same seven shapes, called tans.
</p>
  
<p>
  To solve a tangram puzzle, a player looks at an outline of a tangram shape 
  and re-creates the shape using all seven tans, with no alterations 
  and no overlaps permitted. Each different tangram is representative of a new iteration 
  within a field of opportunity cone. And, like design iterations, each tangram takes 
  on similar, though not identical, shapes.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, the design team is putting together pieces identified in the Discovery Phase, pieces that, 
  through ideation and iteration, become a new product, service, or system.

    they build on one another, just as all tangrams are built from the same seven shapes

</div>

<p>
  Sometimes, this process can seem daunting or even pointless, but, as in the Synthesis portion 
  of the Discovery Phase, you will find that the more you and your team work with the ideas 
  for design, the more possibilities you will see.

<h1>Feedback</h1>

<h2>Your work only gets better</h2>
<p>
  Feedback is an integral part of the design process and should be sought out 
  when designing anything, be it product, service, or system. In design, feedback 
  is a multi-step phase during which the design gradually reaches farther 
  and farther outward from the core team in order to gather feedback 
  from an increasingly large pool of feedback providers.
</p>

<p>
  It&rsquo;s preferable to gather feedback on several of the team&rsquo;s design iterations. Through 
  feedback, the team is able to understand which design ideas might hold up best 
  in real-world conditions and which ones resonate most with participants. Feedback also 
  allows the team to improve and refine the design iterations, using the feedback reviews 
  to gradually phase out the design iterations that are less successful while refining 
  and focusing the more successful ones.
</p>

<p>
  In this section, see the cycle of feedback and revision for a single design solution. 
  Two steps make up a feedback phase: (1) receiving the feedback from an individual or 
  group and (2) making revisions to the product, service, or system based on that feedback. 
  In each feedback step, the circle of people the team reaches out to for feedback moves 
  farther away from the core team and farther into the field of potential participants.
</p>

<p>
  These feedback sessions can take the form of codesign workshops, prototype testing, 
  or other formats depending on the product, service, or system being tested. Guidance 
  on different feedback formats will appear in the Design Phase Operations Guide. 
  For the second step, design revision, the team revises the design internally in order 
  to integrate the feedback from the people that have been asked. Revision activities 
  generally take the shape of tiny synthesis sessions; you will find guidance on those 
  in the Operation Guide as well.

<h2 id="feedback-and-revision">Feedback & revision process map</h2>
<p>
  This Feedback and Revision Process is a basic framework for how to seek out and integrate feedback 
  into a product or service you have designed. Before jumping into the feedback loops, the team needs 
  to review the primary 
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hcd-guide/design/design-phase-principles.htm" title="Design Phase principles" class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible">Design Phase principles</a> 
  as well as the principles you developed during Problem Framing. After an intense iteration phase, in which 
  the team gets deeply involved in details, a refocus onto the participants and the strategic level goals 
  of the project will prove useful.
</p>

<p>
  There are two parts to the feedback process:
</p>

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies for feedback</h2>
<p>
  Creating a strategy for feedback allows the team to collect feedback logically and methodically. 
  The team should test with people who are all current participants or future participants 
  in the product, service, or system that is being created, but those participants can 
  and should be from different areas of the design object&rsquo;s use. For example, if you test 
  with a front-line participant at one stage of testing, you should try to balance that 
  by testing with a leadership level participant at another. Of course, it&rsquo;s not always possible 
  to perfectly construct feedback testing rounds; the purpose of this guidance is not 
  to create an impossible goal of perfection for testing, but to give guiderails 
  on the best way the team can go about this process.
</p>

<p>
  If testing narrows in on a single participant group for reasons of access or timeline, that&rsquo;s okay, 
  but it will result in a not-as-thoroughly testing tested prototype. For this reason, the designed 
  product, service, or system&rsquo;s potential for success is lessened. While this is sometimes acceptable, 
  it is not desirable. Work with your leadership to find a way to either extend your team&rsquo;s timeline or 
  to gain access to the participants you need.

<h3 id="talk-to">Who to talk to: an expanding galaxy</h3>
<p>
  In testing rounds, the design team needs to get feedback from people who have increasing amounts 
  of distance from the project. This is for two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Starting with participants previously involved in or aware of the project allows the team 
    to test low fidelity prototypes with people who have context on the project itself. This 
    will provide actionable feedback to increase the refinement of that prototype quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moving outward to people who have no relationship to or awareness of the project includes 
    the perspective of absolutely new participants. This allows the design team to learn about 
    and correct for the issues new users will have without having to find out those issues during 
    a pilot.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This group will also encounter a closer-to-launch-fidelity prototype, which prepares them 
  for interacting with the new product, service, or system during the pilot phase.

  <p>
    <b>Round 1</b>
    <br>
    An ideal person for round 1 feedback is someone who has previously been involved 
    in the project and is familiar with the research or design of phases of it. 
    This can be one of your primarily research or design partners.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Round 2</b>
    <br>
    A good type of person for round 2 feedback is someone who is close to but 
    not directly involved in the research or design of it. This can be the teammate 
    of one of the Round 1 feedback people who you simply haven't talked 
    to directly before.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_right">
  <p>
    <b>Round 3</b>
    <br>
    It&rsquo; useful for round 3 feedback to talk to someone who is aware of the project, 
    but not previously involved in the research or design. This can be another teammate 
    of people in Rounds 1 or 2 but, for whatever reasons, has been somewhat distanced 
    from the project development.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Round 4</b>
    <br>
    A strong candidate for round 4 feedback is a person who has not previously been 
    in touch with the team or the other participants about this project at all. This 
    person&rsquo; fresh eyes will help head off any quirks or stumbling blocks that, due 
    to familiarity, the previous testers might have taken for granted.

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do with feedback: make changes</h2>
<p>
  Each time the team gathers feedback on the designed product, service, 
  or system, document, meet, and discuss that feedback. Think of this process as 
  a smaller, more concentrated version of the Problem Framing process the team underwent 
  during the early parts of your Discovery Phase. In that process, as new information 
  about the large problem frame was uncovered through desk research and the identification 
  of constraints, the team narrowed in on the specific problem frame in which you were going 
  to operate. Similarly, in this process, as the team tests with participants, 
  you will make changes to your prototype to narrow in on a more useful 
  and resonant product, service, or system for your participants.
</p>

</div>
<div class="hcd-guide__print_page_num">
  <div class="hcd-guide__print_page_counter">4</div>

  <div class="hcd-guide__print_page_num_title">HCD Design Phase Concept Guide</div>
</div>
<div class="hcd-guide__print_wrapper">

<p>
  You&rsquo; work with the resources you have, within the constraints of the product, service, 
  or system you first designed based on your research, to better fit the needs of the 
  ultimate participants in your work. This means tweaks, not systematic changes.
</p>

<p>
  If, at this point, you find the need for large scale, thematic or systematic changes, 
  it means the design that you&rsquo; forwarded does not accurately reflect 
  the opportunities identified in the Discovery phase, so the team will need 
  to start again on the design process. This outcome is not failure; indeed, 
  it simply means you know more about what your participants need. And, if 
  you&rsquo; designed in quick, fast iterations, you&rsquo; easily be able to go back 
  and change your direction without adding a great deal of cost or time to your project.
</p>

<p>
  Below, find another visualization of making small changes based on feedback. As you 
  can see, the tangram shape stays roughly the same shape through all the revisions. 
  They all, vaguely, look like a person standing up in different poses. Those different 
  poses are created by moving around some of the pieces that make up the puzzle. 
  These changes are analogous to the changes the design team should be making 
  in the feedback cycle: ones that change details to the overall design, 
  but not the core idea of the design itself.
</p>

<h2 id="bringing">Bringing it all together</h2>
<p>
  Through the feedback cycle, the team will talk to a variety of people 
  to gather feedback on the product, service, or system the team is designing. 
  Those people will have different positions to and awareness of the project and 
  its history. As you gather feedback from these people, the team will make changes 
  to its design in response to that input.
</p>

<p>
  If the feedback points the team to an entirely different design, that&rsquo; okay, 
  but the team must throw out its design and start the design process itself again. 
  In this case, the team might want to review their Opportunities from their 
  Discovery Phase and identify a new direction in which to go for their new design.

<h2 id="using-feedback">A note on using feedback</h2>
<p>
  It is important to know that not every piece of feedback from each participant 
  can should be integrated. Be aware of the primary principles of the design phase 
  (and review them if you need to) as well as the principles from your problem 
  framing phase.
</p>

<p>
  If your design resonates deeply, people will be excited about its potential, 
  have great ideas for improvements, and really want to see those improvements. 
  Ensure that you compare those suggestions to your original project scope 
  and technical ability. If you cannot integrate an improvement into this stage, 
  that&rsquo;s okay. Communicate to the participant that their feedback is well-placed 
  and important, and that you will note it for integration into a future version 
  or as an idea for a related product or service.

<h1>Design & Implementation</h1>

<h2>No &ldquo;hand-offs&rdquo; no &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo;</h2>
<p>
  When the web was young, the &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo; process of development organically developed 
  as a way content-makers and designers could push content to the engineering teams 
  to be put up on the web. The waterfall process of content development is linear: 
  one team completes their tasks and passes to another team who completes their tasks 
  and then pushes to another team, and so on, until the final product is realized.
</p>

<p>
  Broadly, this process was an adaptation of the traditional, factory-like print 
  media workflow from newspapers and magazines. In this process, the Editorial team 
  would write and edit text content, push it to a Design team to lay the text out 
  on a page and work in the illustrations and photographs, and then the Design team 
  would push the layouts to the Printers, who would implement the design by setting 
  the printing presses to churn out the final product.
</p>

<p>
  This, however, is impossible. Even in a completely controlled environment where there 
  will never be any changes or revisions to content, each group doesn&rsquo;t know every 
  constraint and need of next group, so they will of course sometimes produce work 
  that causes problems or questions for future groups in the process.
</p>

<p>
  Plus, that perfect environment is a fantasy; it does not exist. Changes and revisions 
  happen all the time. In newspapers, this meant that if something happened to change 
  the headlines in the early morning edition, Editorial would rush to write new headlines 
  and article text; Design would freak out a little to source a photo and set the text, 
  and the Printers would have to scramble to reframe the entire front page to include 
  this new article. But what happens to the original content? Where does it go? 
  The Printers need to know, and they also have ideas ­— after all, they understand 
  the mechanics of the page better than anyone. They need to be able to talk 
  to Design and Editorial quickly in order to make content decisions. 
  The three groups absolutely had to work together to get changes made in a way 
  that worked for the newspapers&rsquo; readers. And they had to do it fast.
</p>

</div>
<div class="hcd-guide__print_page_num">
  <div class="hcd-guide__print_page_counter">1</div>
  <hr>
  <div class="hcd-guide__print_page_num_title">HCD Design Phase Concept Guide</div>
</div>
<div class="hcd-guide__print_wrapper">

<p>
  So, in traditional print media, the groups had to overlapping work; they had 
  to talk to each other. This is the same in the current design process. Design teams 
  can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;hand off&rdquo; designs to the people who will implement them. Whether your 
  team is developing print media, a digital product like a website, a real-life object 
  like a kiosk, or a service like a benefits advisory board, working with the people 
  who will implement is crucial to the success of your project. No matter how clear 
  you think you&rsquo;ve been, no matter how top-notch your implementation team is, there 
  will be questions that you need to work out together.
</p>

<p>
  The Design &amp; Implementation phase is analogous to the Communications phase from the 
  HCD Discovery Process: until the Discovery Team effectively communicated their findings 
  to their leadership and partners, the Discovery stage could not be considered complete. 
  Until the Design team has effectively worked with the Implementation team 
  to create final testing through a small pilot and to help that team create 
  an implementation plan, their Design work is not done, because the team has 
  not set the design(s) they crafted up for success: the designs have simply been carefully, 
  painstakingly crafted and then shoved out into the world without support or thought 
  of sustainability.
</p>

<p>
  So never plan to just &ldquo;hand off&rdquo; your design work and roll off a project; stay in 
  it through the first pilot and help you implementation team develop and test an 
  implementation strategy. Only then will you have set your carefully designed solution up 
  for success
