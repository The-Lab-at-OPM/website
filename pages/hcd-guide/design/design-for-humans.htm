<h2>3.1. Consider potential change</h2>

<h3>In stakeholders</h3>
<p>
  The design process strives to include all possible 
  participants <button type="button" class="lab__button" id="lab__button_participants" onclick="showDescription('participants');">&nbsp;</button> 
  and 
  stakeholders <button type="button" class="lab__button" id="lab__button_stakeholders" onclick="showDescription('stakeholders');">&nbsp;</button> 
  in the Discovery phase. The thinking is that, if teams talk to all the people who work 
  with a product, service, or system as participants as well as all those who administer, 
  approve, or oversee it as leadership stakeholders and design with them, 
  then the end result of the work serves the needs of all those people.

<h3>In workflow</h3>
<p>
  As they move through the design phase, teams need to evaluate how the proposed solution 
  might change the workflow or unduly increase the workload for any of these groups. 
  Teams can do this through talking with these impacted groups as the process goes on, 
  testing with them, and listening to anxieties about being expected to do more with no 
  more time allowances or, conversely, with being cut out of access or workflows they 
  may see as key to their work. Finding these participants might seem difficult, 
  but talk to your primary participants to find out who they think might be touched 
  by these changes, contact those groups, and set up testing with them.

    <h2>Scaling USPS</h2>
    <p>
      A well-designed product or service continues to be useful even as circumstances 
      around it may dramatically change. Back in 1775, the creators of the US Postal 
      Service could not foresee that delivery planes, trains, and trucks would one day 
      replace wagons and horses as the way of getting packages from here to there. 
      Technology has radically changed, but the core service offered by the US Post 
      Office remains relevant today, especially as the number of packages sent continues 
      to increase.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, much of the boom in online retail could not have occurred without 
      a reliable, low cost shipping infrastructure already in place. From small, 
      single-person shops to industry giants like Amazon, the US Postal Service&rsquo;s 
      package delivery has allowed businesses of all sizes to engage in digital 
      interactions that result in three dimensional goods showing up at customers&rsquo; 
      doors. This increase in scale, however, has not been without its challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the new services that characterize current package services, 
      like flat rate boxes and weekend delivery, cause a need for the consideration 
      and design for other changes within the USPS itself. For example, in the age 
      of Sunday delivery, how is personnel distributed and yet labor contracts still 
      honored? How might an unexpected glut of packages coming from one USPS site be 
      absorbed into the delivery system quickly and efficiently? Whenever a 
      public-facing feature is added, all these questions and many more have to be designed 
      for inside the organization. These are the types of changes that teams must consider 
      when creating new products, services, or systems in the context of large-scale 
      organizations. One change is rarely one change; in an organization of any size, 
      considering the potential changes to workflow, personnel, et cetera, that will 
      have to occur to support a new or evolved system is a crucial task 
      of the design team.<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />

<h2>3.2 Value new participants</h2>
<p>
  Your design does not exist in a vacuum. It will be integrated into an ecosystem 
  of processes, all of which have their primary participants and stakeholders. 
  For this reason, it is important to understand and anticipate the role of new 
  participants in the your proposed designs.
</p>

<p>
  New participants are people who are entirely fresh to the process, either 
  from the public or from inside the organization. When the team is creating 
  an entirely new product to offer to veterans, or a new system for school 
  administrators to talk to one another, then everyone will be a new participant. 
  Keep in mind, however, that new participants also come from inside the organization. 
  Whoever will distribute or administer that new product is a new participant. 
  Introductions, training, and a consideration of their current workload will 
  all need to be addressed.

    <h2>Thinking of participants: the USAJOBS redesign</h2>
    <p>
      The USA Jobs website is well-known to many federal employees. Through 
      this jobs application portal, one can find a position that fits with 
      a desired career path, background, employment preference, and General 
      Services level. In the past, this site has been run by the federal 
      government as well as by private entities, but it has never gotten 
      good reviews, either from new or experienced participants, in terms 
      of experience or usability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Navigating the site required participants to understand multiple points 
      about their employment opportunities that they might only know if they 
      had already had experience with federal employment. Even if applicants 
      did have previous understanding of the federal hiring system, the site&rsquo;s 
      structure made it almost impossible to understand if they had successfully 
      applied for a job or not. Applicants had no visibility into where their 
      application was in the hiring process. In addition, unless someone 
      explicitly reached out to them, they had no way of knowing whether their 
      application was still moving through the system or if they had been 
      dropped from consideration.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These pain points were considered during the massive redesign of the site 
      from 2015-2018. Although still reflective of a maddeningly byzantine hiring 
      path, both applicants and hiring managers are now able to interact through 
      a more modern, transparent system. This improvement was made possible by 
      constant testing both with new and experienced participants as alternations 
      to the site design were proposed and built. No feature of this site appeared 
      to the public without hearing from participants about their experience with it. 
      This sort of large-scale change is possible only through a long-term commitment 
      to change that is paired with a constant return to focus on the participants themselves.<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile" />
