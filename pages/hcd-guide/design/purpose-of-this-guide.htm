<p>
  The purpose of this Design Guide and its sister Design Phase Operations Guide (available Fall 2019) is not to make an exhaustive list of design
  processes. There are many other works can do that for you, some of which we cite throughout this work. The purpose of this guide
  is to provide context and some select methods for designing products, services, and systems that will help solve the problems
  highlighted from your Discovery phase.

    This four-phase diagram shows the Human-Centered Design process. The four phases shown in the circles are: discovery, design, deliver,
    and measure. These phases are sequential with the expectation that the process as a whole will be cyclical.
    Each part builds on and references each other, and teams can revisit previous phases as they find the need or
    investigate different aspects of their project. This Guide specifically covers the second phase, design.

<p>
  While the Operations Guide will focus on the How of the making process, this Concept Guide helps you understand the
  Why behind the How. After learning the Why, you will be able to cross-apply the contents of these Guides
  to other situations and expanding your understanding of how to grapple with complex problems. Eventually,
  you may find yourself able to contribute back to this work with original methods of your own making.
  That, in fact, would be the author&rsquo;s and sponsors' greatest measure of success: for you to take
  what you have learned here and create original work from your learnings.
</p>

<h2 id="participants">Participants</h2>
<p>
  Throughout this Guide, we will refer to the people for whom we’re designing as participants. This is because the people for whom we’re designing are participating in the use of the products, services, and systems we design. They might participate by using our products, services, and systems in different ways than we intended, adapting them to their own needs, or they might use them for a while and abandon them. In this way, the participants have an active role in the life cycle of our work. This approach is sometimes called Participatory Design; you can learn about and practice it in detail in Participatory Design, one of <a href="https://lab.opm.gov/class-sign-up/" title="and systems" target="_blank" class="hcd-guide__print_footnotes_link">the Lab&rsquo;s open enrollment classes</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In contrast, thinking of participants as &ldquo;users&rdquo; or &ldquo;customers&rdquo; sidelines
  them into simply receiving products, services, and systems. This creates either a supplicant
  (i.e., please give me the thing or service) or an   entitled (e.g., I deserve the thing or service
  without reservation and in the exact way I want it) orientation. This orientation separates and
  creates a power imbalance between the leadership stakeholders sponsoring the work,
  the design teams researching and creating the work, and participants contributing
  their knowledge and voices to the work&rsquo;s development.
</p>


<p>
  In Human-Centered Design, both the designers
  and the people for whom the designed products, services, and systems are made, participate
  in the design, use, and evaluation processes. Participants are equal to the design team
  and the leadership stakeholders, and the project as a whole is driven primarily
  by participants' input. While the designers create the prototypes or models for solutions
  to participant needs, they can only create and refine these products, services, and
  systems through continued collaboration with the participants throughout the design process.
</p>

<h2 id="team-structure">A note on team structure</h2>
<p>
  The Design Phase team should include the team members from the Discovery Phase.
  This team&rsquo;s in-depth understanding of the research as well as their practice in
  working together will help to ensure a successful Design phase that results in a
  useful, positive Delivery and Measure phase experience for the participants
  and stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
  If someone from the Discovery Phase isn't available to join the Design Phase,
  review the team structure you built based on the guidance on pages 22-31 in the
  <a href="https://github.com/labopm/HCD-Guides/blob/master/HCD_Ops_Guide_v12_spreads.pdf" title="Discovery Phase Operations Guide" target="_blank">Discovery Phase Operations Guide</a>
  and evaluate which piece you might be missing. More in-depth guidance on team roles for
  the Design Phase will be provided in the upcoming Design Phase Operations
  Guide (available Fall 2019).
</p>

<p>
  If your Design phase will almost certainly require technical expertise that your
  Discovery team does not have, such as engineering, social work, or graphic design skills,
  identify and recruit an available and sympathetic expert in that area as soon as possible.
  By including this person in your core team before you start the design work itself,
  the team will benefit from their input, and they will be able to invest more deeply
  in the project than if they were brought in simply to realize your product, service,
  or system vision.
