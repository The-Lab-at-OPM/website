<p>These design guides will take you through four phases:</p>

        Discovery
      </a>
      <p class="lab-cta__desc">
        In the Discovery phase, teams participate in research to gather participants’ and stakeholders’ perspectives and experiences in that frame, synthesize the results of that gathering, and define possible parameters for the Design phase.

        Design
      </a>
      <p class="lab-cta__desc">
        This phase is characterized by working through design ideas and building models, also called prototypes, of design solutions.

        Deliver
      </a>
      <p class="lab-cta__desc">
        After prototyping and testing, public sector design teams typically work with implementation teams and other stakeholders to create a small pilot and test the logistical needs around the launch of the product, system, or service the team has designed.

        Measure

        In the Measure phase, the design team should be part of gathering quantitative and qualitative data to learn if the goals and expectations of your work are being met.

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>

<p>Public Sectors employees in need of a rigorous, replicable qualitative research method.</p>

<h3>Did you talk to them?</h3>

<p>
  Yes. Contents are based on in- depth readings of extant HCD Guides, dozens of interviews, codesign sessions, and in-field testing with federal employees regarding their training needs for Human-Centered Design.
</p>

<h2>What’s the vision?</h2>

<p>
  A Human-Centered Design Guide series detailing the HCD phases of Discovery, Design, Deliver, Measure. Each phase will have two guides associated with it: a Concept Guide and a Operations Guide.
</p>

<h3>Concept Guides</h3>

<p>
  The Concept Guides cover the ideas and context that support the phase in the design process. Essays, diagrams, and references to external sources support these works.
</p>

<h3>Operations Guides</h3>

<p>
  The Operations Guides are detailed how-tos to each phase. These Guides are also interactive records of the project's phase so that, in closing the phase, users will have a complete archive of their work. They include practical essays, checklists, references to the Concept Guide(s), and activities to help the user through the phase.
</p>

<h3>Why print?</h3>

<p>
  We decided to create print Guides first based on participants' referrals to various guide series they encountered, such as the Army Training Manual, travel, and language guide series. They also expressed a desire to be able to "throw the Guides in the back of my car", to "have a collection", and to "write all over them."
</p>
<p>
  Now that the Discovery Guides are in use, The Lab is gaining requests for digital, interactive assets as well.
