<h2>Your work only gets better</h2>
<p>
  Feedback is an integral part of the design process and should be sought out when designing anything, be it product,
  service, or system. In design, feedback is a multi-step phase during which the design gradually reaches farther and
  farther outward from the core team in order to gather feedback from an increasingly large pool of feedback providers.

</div>

<p>
  It&rsquo;s preferable to gather feedback on several of the team&rsquo;s design iterations. Through feedback, the team
  is able to understand which design ideas might hold up best in real-world conditions and which ones resonate most with
  participants. Feedback also allows the team to improve and refine the design iterations, using the feedback reviews to
  gradually phase out the design iterations that are less successful while refining and focusing the more successful
  ones.
</p>

<p>
  In this section, see the cycle of feedback and revision for a single design solution. Two steps make up a feedback
  phase: (1) receiving the feedback from an individual or group and (2) making revisions to the product, service, or
  system based on that feedback. In each feedback step, the circle of people the team reaches out to for feedback moves
  farther away from the core team and farther into the field of potential participants.
</p>

<p>
  These feedback sessions can take the form of codesign workshops, prototype testing, or other formats depending on the
  product, service, or system being tested. Guidance on different feedback formats will appear in the Design Phase
  Operations Guide. For the second step, design revision, the team revises the design internally in order to integrate
  the feedback from the people that have been asked. Revision activities generally take the shape of tiny synthesis
  sessions; you will find guidance on those in the Operation Guide as well.
</p>

<h2 id="feedback-and-revision">Feedback & revision process map</h2>
<p>
  This Feedback and Revision Process is a basic framework for how to seek out and integrate feedback into a product or
  service you have designed. Before jumping into the feedback loops, the team needs to review the primary

    title="Design Phase principles"
    class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible"
    >Design Phase principles</a
  >
  as well as the principles you developed during Problem Framing. After an intense iteration phase, in which the team
  gets deeply involved in details, a refocus onto the participants and the strategic level goals of the project will
  prove useful.

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies for feedback</h2>
<p>
  Creating a strategy for feedback allows the team to collect feedback logically and methodically. The team should test
  with people who are all current participants or future participants in the product, service, or system that is being
  created, but those participants can and should be from different areas of the design object&rsquo;s use. For example,
  if you test with a front-line participant at one stage of testing, you should try to balance that by testing with a
  leadership level participant at another. Of course, it&rsquo;s not always possible to perfectly construct feedback
  testing rounds; the purpose of this guidance is not to create an impossible goal of perfection for testing, but to
  give guiderails on the best way the team can go about this process.
</p>

<p>
  If testing narrows in on a single participant group for reasons of access or timeline, that&rsquo;s okay, but it will
  result in a not-as-thoroughly testing tested prototype. For this reason, the designed product, service, or
  system&rsquo;s potential for success is lessened. While this is sometimes acceptable, it is not desirable. Work with
  your leadership to find a way to either extend your team&rsquo;s timeline or to gain access to the participants you
  need.
</p>

<h3 id="talk-to">Who to talk to: an expanding galaxy</h3>
<p>
  In testing rounds, the design team needs to get feedback from people who have increasing amounts of distance from the
  project. This is for two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Starting with participants previously involved in or aware of the project allows the team to test low fidelity
    prototypes with people who have context on the project itself. This will provide actionable feedback to increase the
    refinement of that prototype quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moving outward to people who have no relationship to or awareness of the project includes the perspective of
    absolutely new participants. This allows the design team to learn about and correct for the issues new users will
    have without having to find out those issues during a pilot.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This group will also encounter a closer-to-launch-fidelity prototype, which prepares them for interacting with the new
  product, service, or system during the pilot phase.
</p>

    <b>Note: </b>All participants outlined below should be current or future users of the product, service, or system
    that the team is currently designing. The differences between these people are their closeness to the research and
    design process of the new product, system, or service.

  <p>
    <b>Round 1</b>
    <br />
    An ideal person for round 1 feedback is someone who has previously been involved in the project and is familiar with
    the research or design of phases of it. This can be one of your primarily research or design partners.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_right">
  <p>
    <b>Round 2</b>
    <br />
    A good type of person for round 2 feedback is someone who is close to but not directly involved in the research or
    design of it. This can be the teammate of one of the Round 1 feedback people who you simply haven't talked to
    directly before.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__clear_spacer"></div>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_left">
  <p>
    <b>Round 3</b>
    <br />
    It&rsquo; useful for round 3 feedback to talk to someone who is aware of the project, but not previously involved in
    the research or design. This can be another teammate of people in Rounds 1 or 2 but, for whatever reasons, has been
    somewhat distanced from the project development.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_right">
  <p>
    <b>Round 4</b>
    <br />
    A strong candidate for round 4 feedback is a person who has not previously been in touch with the team or the other
    participants about this project at all. This person&rsquo; fresh eyes will help head off any quirks or stumbling
    blocks that, due to familiarity, the previous testers might have taken for granted.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__clear_spacer"></div>
<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do with feedback: make changes</h2>
<p>
  Each time the team gathers feedback on the designed product, service, or system, document, meet, and discuss that
  feedback. Think of this process as a smaller, more concentrated version of the Problem Framing process the team
  underwent during the early parts of your Discovery Phase. In that process, as new information about the large problem
  frame was uncovered through desk research and the identification of constraints, the team narrowed in on the specific
  problem frame in which you were going to operate. Similarly, in this process, as the team tests with participants, you
  will make changes to your prototype to narrow in on a more useful and resonant product, service, or system for your
  participants.
</p>

<p>
  You&rsquo; work with the resources you have, within the constraints of the product, service, or system you first
  designed based on your research, to better fit the needs of the ultimate participants in your work. This means tweaks,
  not systematic changes.
</p>

<figure class="usa-prose__hcd-guide__mobile_figure">
  <img
    src="/website/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/shapes_v1.gif"
    alt="Animation showing the evolution of the original design through slightly different combinations of tangram shapes after every round of feedback, without changing the core of the design."
    class="content-print-img usa-prose__hcd-guide_mobile_image"
  />
  <figcaption>
    This animation shows how the design changes as the team receives feedback on the proposed design. After each
    feedback round, the team makes changes to the design to reflect the needs expressed by the participants. Important
    to note: the changes should be to the details, not the core concept, of the design. If changes to the core concept
    of the design appear to be needed, the team should consult their discovery phase findings once again, and restart
    their design phase.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  If, at this point, you find the need for large scale, thematic or systematic changes, it means the design that
  you&rsquo; forwarded does not accurately reflect the opportunities identified in the Discovery phase, so the team will
  need to start again on the design process. This outcome is not failure; indeed, it simply means you know more about
  what your participants need. And, if you&rsquo; designed in quick, fast iterations, you&rsquo; easily be able to go
  back and change your direction without adding a great deal of cost or time to your project.
</p>

<p>
  Below, find another visualization of making small changes based on feedback. As you can see, the tangram shape stays
  roughly the same shape through all the revisions. They all, vaguely, look like a person standing up in different
  poses. Those different poses are created by moving around some of the pieces that make up the puzzle. These changes
  are analogous to the changes the design team should be making in the feedback cycle: ones that change details to the
  overall design, but not the core idea of the design itself.
</p>

    src="/website/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/revision-dance_v3.gif"
    alt="Animation of tangram shapes being repositioned and flipped around to form various new shapes, while keeping the core of the design the same."
    class="content-print-img usa-prose__hcd-guide_mobile_image"
  />
  <figcaption>
    This animation shows how, as the team makes changes to the design, the core thematic structure of the design should
    remain consistent and resonant with the participants&rsquo;core needs. At this stage, changes should be to details,
    not to overall design themes or needs.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="bringing">Bringing it all together</h2>
<p>
  Through the feedback cycle, the team will talk to a variety of people to gather feedback on the product, service, or
  system the team is designing. Those people will have different positions to and awareness of the project and its
  history. As you gather feedback from these people, the team will make changes to its design in response to that input.
</p>

<figure class="usa-prose__hcd-guide__mobile_figure">
  <img
    src="/website/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/comet_v2.gif"
    alt="Animation of a design iteration in the form of a tangram shape orbiting elliptical rings representing rounds of feedback. Every next ellipse expands further from the viewer to represent the team gathering feedback from people increasingly further away from the team, product, service, or system itself. As the current design iteration (the tangram shape) orbits one feedback loop and moves into another, the shape itself changes to represent the new iteration as a result of that feedback."
    class="content-print-img usa-prose__hcd-guide_mobile_image"
  />
  <figcaption>
    This animation demonstrates that, as the team iterates on their design, they should seek out participants who are
    increasingly removed from the design process. In the first round of feedback, stay close to the participants who are
    familiar with your project. But, as the iterative loops continue, travel farther away from that group. This ensures
    that the feedback you receive reflects the experience of people who have not had previous information on your design
    work, and thusly do not have prior experience with or impression of the design. These people can provide "fresh
    eyes" on the team&rsquo; design, helping to ensure that your work will be clear to future, wholly new participants.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  If the feedback points the team to an entirely different design, that&rsquo; okay, but the team must throw out its
  design and start the design process itself again. In this case, the team might want to review their Opportunities from
  their Discovery Phase and identify a new direction in which to go for their new design.
</p>

<h2 id="using-feedback">A note on using feedback</h2>
<p>
  It is important to know that not every piece of feedback from each participant can should be integrated. Be aware of
  the primary principles of the design phase (and review them if you need to) as well as the principles from your
  problem framing phase.
</p>

<p>
  If your design resonates deeply, people will be excited about its potential, have great ideas for improvements, and
  really want to see those improvements. Ensure that you compare those suggestions to your original project scope and
  technical ability. If you cannot integrate an improvement into this stage, that&rsquo;s okay. Communicate to the
  participant that their feedback is well-placed and important, and that you will note it for integration into a future
  version or as an idea for a related product or service.
